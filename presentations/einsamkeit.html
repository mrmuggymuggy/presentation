					<h2>The loneliness and the mental health</h2>
					<h3>Odyssée to our interieur life</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What exactly is the loneliness</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>is it to "be" alone ?</li>
						<li>is it to feel alone ?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>when the loneliness happens?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>During the conflits with our closed ones, when we suddenly realize the fragility of our relations</li>
						<li>when we feel not supported or supports from our closed ones does not relief us </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Nevertheless I believe the most disconcerting moments of loneliness are those which grow from very deep inside of us, even though in the apparence we are surrounded by our closed ones and loved. we can feel the solitude in a group, in a couple.. so what is the source of this feeling? 
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Too high expectation to a relation?</li>
						<li>The conviction that we are too unique and too distinct to be understanded by our kinds? </li>
						<li>The conscience that there is always a part of non communicable between humain? </li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
						The loneliness is not just a suffer, it is also a route to our inner self, it is an occasion to us to introspect by suspending the actions and distractions
					</p>
				</section>


				<section>
					<p>
						Some even consider it as a part of spirituel hygene, The loneliness is to our spirit is as the diet to our body, mortal when it lasts too long, but very essential -- Marquis de Vauvenargues
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
						When the loneliness is not daily based as an emotional prison, it could even act as a source of fertility. Knowing how to be alone allows us to be truly with ourself without the distractions of the social activities
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
						Today, with our technologies, it removes our time of to be alone, some recent studies shows, paradoxically, time spent in front of screens, even accentuate our feeling of loneliness
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
						I believe, the feeling of loneless is neither to be flighted nor to be fleed away, it is to be explored, as a part of essential uncomfortable moment of our spiritual self.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
						Maybe the difficulty does not lay on the loneliness, it might be the wrong usage of our social connections, the loneliness is to make us even appreciate more moments of connection, sharing and fraternity
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						It can also help us to inspect our excessive and irrealistical expections to our closed ones, calm down our desires to be understanded on our feelings. because it is useless to attempt in living in a fusion and perfect understanding, it is better to attach to a regular and imperfect exchanges
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Conclusions</h2>
					<p>
						To be humain, is to accept sincerely our part of innate loneliness, there is always a small part of us non communicable, non sharable. By knowing the feeling of loneliness is experienced and shared by all of us, maybe, it makes us feel less lonely
